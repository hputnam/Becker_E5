## Abstract 
In this study, we experimentally enriched Pocillopora spp. corals with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate for 15 months on an oligotrophic fore reef in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Our physiological analysis of coral fragments and thermal performance show that in an oligotrophic fore reef environment, nutrient enrichment can cause changes in coral endosymbiont physiology that increases the performance of the coral holobiont. To assess the molecular underpinnings of the enhanced thermal performance due to chronic low-level nutrient enrichment, we assessed gene expression with RNASeq and the potential for gene expression regulation through whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS).
