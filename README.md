## Abstract 
We experimentally enriched corals with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate for 15 months on an oligotrophic fore reef in Mo'orea. Our physiological analysis of coral fragments and thermal performance curve show that in an oligotrophic fore reef environment, nutrient enrichment can cause changes in coral endosymbiont physiology that increase the performance of the coral holobiont. To assess the molecular underpinning of the enhaced thermal perfromance due to chronic low nutrient enrichment, we assessed gene expression with RNASeq and the potential for gene expresssion regulation through whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Sequencing of mtORF for 32 samples of Pocillopora spp. (n=16 per treatment) identified X species
