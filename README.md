## Abstract 
Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a single genotype to produce a variety of phenotypes in response to environmental conditions, is of particular interest with respect to symbiotic organisms such as reef-building corals that face degradation due to anthropogenic climate change. Given that corals and their endosymbionts engage in a nutritionally symbiotic relationship that allows for survival in rapidly changing environments, this system presents a unique opportunity to test the effect of nutrient enrichment on the endosymbionts and consequential downstream gene expression regulation (e.g., DNA methylation) changes in the coral host. To this end, we tested the effects of in situ exposure of Pocillopora meandrina in Mo'orea, French Polynesia to moderately increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate for 15-months that drove increased endosymbiont densities and resulted in enhanced photosynthetic rates at increased temperatures. In response to chronic nutrient exposure, the coral host displayed differential gene expression, specifically in stress response, nutrient metabolism, and symbiotic nutrient exchange and signaling pathways. Additionally, differential methylation was present, particularly in genes associated with stress response, DNA maintenance and function, and carbohydrate metabolism. We found that as DNA methylation increases, gene expression also increases for all genes, with slightly higher explanatory effects on DEGs and with genes in key response functions of corals exposed to nutrients. Our results support that changing environmental conditions, such as nutrient exposure, can be transduced and modulated by the symbiont, perceived and responded to by the host through gene expression, and regulated epigenetically. While DNA methylation may not be the only, or even primary mechanism of gene expression regulation, indirect associations at higher levels of functional organization support that DNA methylation has a role in the complex regulatory repertoire of the coral holobiont.
